# Programming-Langauges
This repository contains a pascal scanner, Parser and python bracket matching project for Programming languages class.

Some of the code for the scanner and parser was coded by Dr. Thomas Turner from the Department of Math and Science at the University of Central Oklahoma. We used/changed code to make it work for Pascal.
